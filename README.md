# Copy DIB to TXT

This extension will save a polyglot notebook (.dib) file as a text file so that when checked into source you can see the changes.

This is a bug introduced by the polyglot notebook developers that chose the .DIB extension which was already in use as a binary file, therefore it does not render in Azure DevOps as a text file and cannot/willnot show the changes.

Example:
    ```PolyglotNotebook.dib``` copied to: ```PolyglotNotebook.dib.txt``` on save.
